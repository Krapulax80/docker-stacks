# docker-stacks
All my docker stacks on the home server.

In it's initial form, the repository is set into 3 folders, each representing a Docker stack.
- the "core" stack is essential for the operation of the server. This stack should be rarely edited
- the "mediaserver" stack are the various tools providing media services
- the "devops" stack is mainly related to learning and testing
